Configuring tzk
===============

Change into a directory you'd like to use as your Zettelkasten repository.
The directory should be empty, so you'll probably want to create a new one, e.g.:

```
$ mkdir my_zettelkasten
$ cd my_zettelkasten
```

Run ``tzk init``.
This will install TiddlyWiki,
set up a Git repository,
